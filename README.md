# Mapping before & after

Make a image of data of an area in OSM with data from 2 dates, showing what was changed before & after

## Usage

First download an OSM history from, e.g. from [Geofabrik's Download service](https://osm-internal.download.geofabrik.de/). You will need to log in with an OSM account.

A `BBOX` can be can be calculated with [Klokan Technologies's BoundingBox tool](https://boundingbox.klokantech.com/), use the `CSV` format.

The `BEFORE_TIME` & `AFTER_TIME` are ISO timestamps.

```
./make.sh OSM_HISTORY_FILE.osh.pbf BEFORE_TIME AFTER_TIME BBOX MIN_ZOOM MAX_ZOOM
